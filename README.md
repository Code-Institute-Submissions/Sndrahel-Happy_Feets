### This project was tested with the following browsers: 
- Laptop MacOS Big Sur (ver 11.4): Google Chrome


### The following steps were taken:

- Manually testing via Devtools 
- Non-logged in user attempting to access content (refused)
- All buttons and links tested
- Users availing of the like button
- Image uploads tested - large, incorrect format etc. 
- Form tested with correct and incorrect detail 
- Clear user experience & navigation
- Picture loading speed
- Login/register/logout functionalities
- Edit, add, delete items & posts functionalities
- bugs or disabled links

### Issues / Unfixed Bugs:

- Like button not working properly with hovering as well as counting likes - not fixed 
- Testimonial carousell indicators doesnt float within the testimonial card on smaller devices - not fixed
- When running CSS validator there is alot of warnings depending on the full bootstrap theme choosen.
- I had issues with making the contact post - fixed.
- All through I had many issues to make it work as I planned for in the beginning. The main reason for that depends on that I choosed to go with a template instead of doing it all by my self from scratch. I discoverd during the way that it took me much more time to try to change the prewritten scripts then it would have done if I just started from scratch. Al though it has been a good experience with alot of lessons.

# Deployment

## Setting up
---
The website of this project requires back-end technologies such as server, application, and database so the website is deployed in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), which is a cloud platform with a service supporting several programming languages, because GitHub can only host a static website. Heroku Postgres is used for the database, which is also a cloud-based platform, is used to store static files and images as Heroku has [no files system to store new files


## Setting up Heroku App
---
- Create an app in Heroku. Click *New*, put App name and select region.
- Add Heroku Postgres for the database.
- Install `gunicorn`, `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2-binary` to use Heroku Postgres, and run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` command to add them on requirments.txt.
- Update `settings.py` of the app. Import `dj_database_url`, comment out sqlite databases and add dj databases variable temporary while the database is transferred to Heroku Postgres.
- Run `python3 manage.py showmigrations` command to see the status of migrations (Currently not migrated). Run `python3 manage.py migrate` command to migrate.
- Create a super user with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` command for product admin.
- Create a **Procfile** which specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup.
- Temporary disable collectstatic by setting `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1` and host name of Heroku to allowed hosts in `settings.py`.
- Generate a new secret key, set it up in Heroku and update `settings.py`. Change the setting of Debug mode that only True in Development mode.


## Deployment through Heroku
---
- Navigate to the "Deploy" section.
- Scroll down to "Deployment Method" and select "GitHub".
- Authorize the connection of Heroku to GitHub.
- Search for your GitHub repository name, and select the correct repository.
- For Deployment there are two options, Automatic Deployments or Manual.
- Automatic Deployment: This will prompt Heroku to re-build your app each time you push your code to GitHub.
- Manual Deployment: This will only prompt Heroku to build your app when you manually tell it to do so.
- Ensure the correct branch is selected "master/Main", and select a deployment method. For this project I chose Manual Deployment.


## How to Fork the respository
---
- Log into GitHub.
- In Github go to (https://github.com/Sndrahel/Handywoman.git).
- In the top right hand corner click "Fork".
- A copy of the repository will then be added to your repositories page.

## How to clone the repository
---
- Go to the GitHub repository.
- Locate the Code button which is to the left of the green gitpod button and click it.
- Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or Github CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
- Open Git Bash.
- Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory.
- Type git clone and paste the URL from the clipboard.
- Press Enter to create your local clone.
