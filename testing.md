## Test Strategy:
---

To test responsiveness of the site [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) will be used. This ensures the site is usable on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.

To ensure the site is fit for purpose all user stories and features documented in the main README.md file are to be tested. The test procedures
and results are documented below.

The code (HTML/CSS/JS/Python) must also satisfy the requirements of the online validation tools. These are:
* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/). Check the markup of web documents.
* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Check Cascading Style Sheets
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/). Javascript code quality tool. 
* [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/). Checks Python code for PEP8 compliance.

Google Lighthouse will be used to check the Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and Search Engine Optimisation of the website.

[Django unittest documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/overview/)

Using Django's standard unit test library module `unittest`, a class based approach was used to build tests for each app's functionality.

For the checkout app in the project, the following files were tested:
  - `views.py` tested by `test_views.py`
  - `models.py` tested by `test_models.py`
  - `forms.py` tested by `test_forms.py`
